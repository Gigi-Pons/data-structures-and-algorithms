# Matching Algorithms

## ValidParatheses_Stack
This algorithm checks if a string of brackets is valid by making sure that every opening bracket has a matching closing bracket, and that all brackets close in the correct order. It uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets, and matches them as closing brackets appear. If everything lines up perfectly, the string is valid!
