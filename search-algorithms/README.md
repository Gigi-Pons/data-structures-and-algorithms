# Sorting Algorithms
## Bubble_SelectionSort
This repository contains an implementation of the selection sort and the bubble sort in C++.

## SquaredArray
This file implements an algorithm that uses O(n) and another one that uses O(n log n) as time complexities.
It takes an ordered array of numbers and returns an array with the square of each number.  This implementation
is done using Java.

## TwoSum_BinarySearch
This algorithm finds two numbers in a sorted array that add up to a target by fixing one number and using binary search to find the other. It loops through each number, calculates what the second number should be, and searches for it in the remaining part of the array using binary search. This approach is efficient because it avoids using extra memory and reduces the number of comparisons with binary search.
