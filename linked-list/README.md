# Reverse_Linked_List
This code flips a linked list backwards so that the last node becomes the first. 
It walks through the list one node at a time, and for each one, it turns the arrow 
to point the opposite way. By the end, it returns the new head of the reversed list.

# Merge_Linked_List
 This algorithm merges two sorted linked lists into a single sorted linked list by comparing values one node at a time. 
 It uses a dummy starter node to simplify the merge process and builds the new list by attaching the smaller node at each step. 
 The final result skips the dummy node and returns the actual head of the merged list.
